Integrating search allows users to efficiently locate specific information within a dataset. The controller's index action,
augmented with a conditional query based on the search parameter, enables dynamic filtering of records. The associated view incorporates 
a user-friendly search form, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users to interact with and retrieve relevant data.

step - 6
The introduction of a new field through database migration and model validation expands the data model's capabilities.
The model-level validation ensures that the new field adheres to predefined criteria, such as presence and maximum length, 
safeguarding data consistency. The update to the view, particularly the form template, accommodates the new field, enabling users to input
and manipulate the additional data seamlessly.

step - 7
Validation in the model and controller safeguards the integrity of the application's data.
By imposing rules on the allowed content and structure of data, validation prevents erroneous or incomplete entries.
In the controller, handling validation errors gracefully by rendering the appropriate view ensures a smooth user experience,
guiding users to correct any input issues.
